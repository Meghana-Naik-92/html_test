# Contact Me Page - My First GitHub Project

Hello world, 
I'm Meghana, an ambitious and curious engineering student exploring the world of web development.

This is my first project on GitHub, and it's a simple yet meaningful step in my learning journey a basic Contact Me webpage built using pure HTML.

## Why I Built This
I wanted to start learning how websites work from scratch, and what better way than to build something useful and personal? This project helped me understand:
- HTML structure and tags
- GitHub Pages deployment
- The power of learning by doing
